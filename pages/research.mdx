### üìå Instant Family

Specify faces of people, and generate images with all of their faces present.

- May 2024
- Authors: Chanran Kim, Jeongin Lee, Shichang Joung, Bongmo Kim, Yeul-Min Baek
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19427
- Code: no weights or code available yet; coming soon?

### üìå Story Diffusion

Some attention-technique to generate consistent characters somehow?

- May 2024
- Authors: ByteDance
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01434
- Info: https://storydiffusion.github.io/
- Code: I‚Äôm not sure how this works
  - https://github.com/HVision-NKU/StoryDiffusion

### üìå Stylus

When the user types a prompt, this meta-expert-system selects from a list of available LoRAs to help it
better fulfill the user‚Äôs request. It automatically mixes these in.

- Authors: Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkley, Google Deepmind
- Info and
  paper: [https://stylus-diffusion.github.io](https://stylus-diffusion.github.io/?utm_source=sinkin.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=china-s-sora-competitor-midjourney-ceo-s-prediction-instantfamily-storydiffusion-stylus)
- Code: Nothing yet
  - https://github.com/stylus-diffusion/stylus

### üìå Align Your Steps

Previously, denoise-scheduling in diffusion-models was all tribal-knowledge of ‚Äúthis worked good
enough for me‚Äù, but in this paper Nvidia does the first mathematical / theoretical analysis to find the optimal
denoising schedule for each model. Sticking to this schedule results in better-quality images that also better adhere to
text-prompts. Numerical-vectors are provided for SD1, SDXL, SVD, and DeepFloyd-IF models.

- April 2024
- Authors: Nvidia
- Info:
  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/AlignYourSteps/?utm_source=sinkin.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=hidiffusion-videogigagan-align-your-steps-hyper-sd-predicting-political-views
- Library used: none
- Code: none
- ComfyUI implementations: this was built into ComfyUI core as an array of numbers, produced by an ‚Äòalign your steps‚Äô
  node.
  - https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/10fcd09f4af5de62aa662dab03320cfca46b0edb/comfy_extras/nodes_align_your_steps.py

### üìå HiDiffusion

A technique that modifies existing stable-diffusion models, allowing them to generate higher-resolution
images (2048px or 4096px) directly, without the duplication-artifacts introduced by tiling. Basically, the diffusion
model is able to attend to all pixels of the image at the same time, even at higher resolution. It also provides a
noteable speed improvement.

- April 2024
- Authors: MEGVII Technology
- Info and
  paper: [https://hidiffusion.github.io/](https://hidiffusion.github.io/?utm_source=sinkin.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=hidiffusion-videogigagan-align-your-steps-hyper-sd-predicting-political-views)
- Library used: pypi-package for diffusers
- Code: takes a diffuser‚Äôs pipeline class and modifies it with one line of code. It works on SDXL, SDXL Turbo, SD2, and
  SD1.
  - https://github.com/megvii-research/HiDiffusion
- ComfyUI implementations:
  - https://github.com/florestefano1975/ComfyUI-HiDiffusion
  - https://github.com/blepping/comfyui_jankhidiffusion
  - https://medium.com/diffusion-images/hidiffusion-in-comfyui-higher-resolution-and-faster-generations-with-stable-diffusion-28e93ec91a07

### üìå Hyper-SD

This is provided as LoRA add-on for SD1 and SDXL; it enables these models to run in 1 - 8 steps, rather
than a more conventional 20 - 25 steps, greatly reducing inference time. It compares well to SDXL-Turbo (1 step),
SDXL-Lightning (1 step), and even SDXL-base itself with 50-steps.

- April 2024
- Authors: ByteDance
- Info and Paper: https://hyper-sd.github.io/
- Model Weights: https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/Hyper-SD/tree/main
  - There‚Äôs a different LoRA for different number of steps, i.e., there are different models for 1, 2, 4, and 8 steps.
- Library: easily implemented in diffusers; just load the LoRA, fuse them into the pipeline, then use the TCD scheduler.
- ComfyUI implementations: since it‚Äôs just a LoRA, it doesn‚Äôt require any new code; you just need to use the TCD (
  Trajectory Consistent Distillation) custom-node as a scheduler, and adjust the eta-parameter:

### üìå VideoGigaGAN

A video-super-resolution model from Adobe that upscales videos from 128px to 1024 px.

- April 2024
- Authors: Adobe
- Info and paper: https://videogigagan.github.io/
- Code: lol lol; bro Adobe would never
- Code: being recreated by lucidrains:

https://github.com/lucidrains/videogigagan-pytorch

### üìå PanFusion

360-degree panoramic image generation, trained on Matterport 3D data. Works well for generating Skyboxes.
This is apparently an improvement over the previous method called MV Diffusion from July
2023 (https://github.com/Tangshitao/MVDiffusion). This has its own 8.5 GB model.

- April 2024
- Authors: ???
- Info and paper: https://chengzhag.github.io/publication/panfusion/
- Code: https://github.com/chengzhag/PanFusion
- Library: uses diffusers as a dependency, but is not part of the diffusers library yet. It has its own custom-made
  python scripts.
- ComfyUI implementation:
  - None that I know of yet
- Note: there is also an older paper, Feb 2023, that tries panoramic image generation that was included in the diffusers
  library https://huggingface.co/papers/2302.08113

### üìå Trajectory Consistent Distillation

A new scheduler used with turbo-diffusion models. Replaces the LCM (latent consistency model) scheduler.

- March 2024
- Authors: Jianbin Zheng, Southern China University of Technology
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19159
- Info: https://mhh0318.github.io/tcd/
- Code: implemented into the diffusers library as an alternative scheduler.
  - https://github.com/jabir-zheng/TCD
- ComfyUI implementations:
  - https://github.com/JettHu/ComfyUI-TCD
  - https://github.com/dfl/comfyui-tcd-scheduler

### üìå CTM (Consistent Trajectory Models)

Alleges TCD plagiarized their work. Same thing.

- March 2024
- Authors: Sony AI, Carnegie Mellon
- Info: https://consistencytrajectorymodel.github.io/CTM/

### üìå Stable Diffusion 3

New model from Stability AI.

- Authors: Stability AI
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206
- Code and weights: coming eventually

### üìå PhotoMaker

Provide identity-preserving reference-images.

- December 2023
- Authors: TencentARC
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04461
- Library: custom diffusers pipeline; just import `PhotoMakerStableDiffusionXLPipeline` and run it.
- Code: https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker
- Model Weights: https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/PhotoMaker/tree/main
- ComfyUI implementation:
  - Officially added to
    core: https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/commit/d1533d9c0f1dde192f738ef1b745b15f49f41e02

### üìå GigaGAN

Text-to-image GAN that operates on a latent space; it has fast inference time (it‚Äôs not using a multi-step
diffusers), and a smooth latent space, allowing for interpolation between images and styles.

- March 2023
- Authors: Adobe
- Paper, March 2023: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511
- Code: Adobe obviously they never released any code / model-weights (dicks), but an independent dev reproduced their
  architecture in PyTorch:

https://github.com/lucidrains/gigagan-pytorch

This repo was abandoned in late-2023. Idk if anyone actually ever trained a version of this model and used it? I don‚Äôt
think Adobe themselves ever deployed a production version of this either, despite the hype.
